# Scoop Arbitrariae Bucket [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/cx5wfxjavur7hasc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pigsflew/scoop-arbitrariae/branch/master)

This is a [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) Bucket for items which I use which cannot currently be found in official (or other) scoop buckets. If any of them are later in the official buckets, they may be deprecated or removed from this source.

Add the bucket using the following snippet:

```
scoop bucket add arbitrariae 'https://github.com/pigsflew/scoop-arbitrariae.git'
```

This bucket's contents should be listed at [scoop.netlify's apps page](https://scoop.netlify.com/apps/).

Special thanks to @Ash258 for the [GenericBucket template](https://github.com/Ash258/GenericBucket).
